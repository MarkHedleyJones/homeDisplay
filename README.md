This repository holds a web based application server for creating and syncronising shopping lists.
It is designed to be connected to a barcode scanner and used in the kitchen.
Features:
* Trello syncronisation
* Barcode scanner integration
* Written in Python using Flask
* Uses Googles Material Design Lite page styleing
* Google calendar syncronisation

You can run it on a Raspberry Pi so it's always running. Use a wall-timer to turn the screen off at night and when nobody's home.
